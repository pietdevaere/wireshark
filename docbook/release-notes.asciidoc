= Wireshark {wireshark-version} Release Notes
// AsciiDoc quick reference: http://powerman.name/doc/asciidoc

This is a semi-experimental release intended to test new features for
Wireshark 2.6.

== What is Wireshark?

Wireshark is the world's most popular network protocol analyzer. It is
used for troubleshooting, analysis, development and education.

== What's New

* Display filter buttons can now be edited / removed / disabled via a context
  menu directly from the toolbar

* Drag&Drop filter fields to the display filter toolbar or edit to create
  a button on the fly or apply the filter as a display filter.

* The installation step for Wireshark will now install headers required to
  build plugins. A pkg-config file is provided to help with this
  (see doc/plugins.example for details). Note you must still rebuild all
  plugins between minor releases (X.Y).

//=== Bug Fixes

//The following bugs have been fixed:

//* ws-buglink:5000[]
//* ws-buglink:6000[Wireshark bug]
//* cve-idlink:2014-2486[]
//* Wireshark convinced you to switch seats on the plane while neglecting to tell you that its seat was noticeably moist.

=== New and Updated Features

The following features are new (or have been significantly updated)
since version 2.4.0:
* Add color support for TShark with --color option (non-Windows only).
* The "matches" display filter operator is now case-insensitive.
* Display expression (button) preferences have been converted to a UAT.
  This puts the display expressions in their own file.  Wireshark still
  supports preference files that contain the old preferences, but new
  preference files will be written without the old fields.
* SMI private enterprise numbers are now read from the "enterprises.tsv" configuration file.
* QUIC dissector is renamed to G(oogle) QUIC (quic => gquic).
* Selected packet number can now be shown in the Status Bar by enabling
  Preferences -> Appearance -> Layout -> Show selected packet number.
* File load time in Status Bar is now disabled by default and can be enabled in
  Preferences -> Appearance -> Layout -> Show file load time.
* Support for G.729 codec in the RTP Player (via the bcg729 library).
* Support for hardware-timestamping of packets
* Improved NetMon .cap support with comments, event tracing, network filter,
  network info types and some Message Analyzer exported types.
* Personal plugins folder on Linux/Unix is now ~/.local/lib/wireshark/plugins.
* Add Flow Graph functionality to TShark using -z
* Capinfos now prints SHA256 hashes in addition to RIPEMD160 and SHA1. MD5 output
  has been removed.

== Getting Wireshark

Wireshark source code and installation packages are available from
https://www.wireshark.org/download.html.

=== Vendor-supplied Packages

Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Wireshark packages. You can
usually install or upgrade Wireshark using the package management system
specific to that platform. A list of third-party packages can be found
on the https://www.wireshark.org/download.html#thirdparty[download page]
on the Wireshark web site.

== File Locations

Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for preference
files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries. These locations vary
from platform to platform. You can use Aboutâ†’Folders to find the default
locations on your system.
